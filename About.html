				<h3>Hello!</h3>
				<p class="intro">
					<p>I am Stuart, a carpenter and certified cabinetmaker in Saskatoon, SK.  I've been working with wood for over 35 years. My interest started by learning and working in the shop with my dad as a young boy.  I have always loved working with a variety of soft and hard woods - domestics like oak, maple, birch, walnut, cedar, cherry, mahogany, willow, spruce, fir, and exotics like African purple heartwood, tigerwood, and zebrawood - to name a few.</p>
					<p>While I make projects from blueprints, I can and do enjoy the challenge of creating unique, customized designs. As any good carpenter worth their salt should be, as long as I have a napkin and pen and we can sit down over a coffee to hammer out the details, I can create what is needed or imagined, but it really helps when I get a photo or we discuss the pre-conceptualized finished idea and basic finished size to work from, too.</p>
					<p>There is one material I just don't work with - K3 particle board.  I will make any project out of any wood and I will warranty it, so long as it is a real wood.  I do not work with "K3 anything". </p>
					<p>Repairs?  I can do that, too.  Sometimes those fancy, foreign, no-warranty cabinet drawers and doors that people paid good money for six months ago in their new kitchen just do not stand up to normal use and now the cabinets are not holding together as well as they were when they were installed.  Believe it or not, there is a certain company that seems to be keeping me in coffee money by fixing them, but I only do cabinets that do NOT have a warranty by local or North American manufacturers.  I do not claim to be an antique repair person. Lots of other people do that. I do not finish OR re-finish anything.  That is not what I do.  I build and I construct and, depending on the item, repair. </p>
					<p>You can see these different personalities and characteristics in each project in my book that makes every single item unique to itself, which means I might make the same object by name twice, but no two objects will ever be the same, unique to each person who owns it. </p>
					<p>I like to show people what I can do, so here is my project book of work, most recent, some getting on in years, but all still standing over time as well as I made them years ago.</p>
